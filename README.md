# Summary
My goal is to become full stack web developer in the near future. Moreover I want to share my knowledge with people who want to learn Programming  via my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4RBPcOHcei3gDOwt3IjGHw). I am quite interested in learning as well as teaching what I know to people who are eager to learn something new which could be useful in their career path. I have no Plan B, that's why I always try my best to finish my plan A, and I always will.
